This is the "profielwerkstuk" of Raf Brenninkmeijer and me; a project that must be done at the end of secondary school (80 hours p.p.). This was done in 2021/2022, but we didn't use GitHub at the time. Now everything is uploaded here.

We basically programmed an artificial neural network that plays the board game Go in C++.

The report is in Dutch.

We won the ["Pythagoras profielwerkstuk"-prize](https://www.pyth.eu/verslag-pythagoras-pws-prijs-2022), 2nd place.
